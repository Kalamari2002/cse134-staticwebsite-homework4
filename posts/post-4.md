Heading to the library, leaving the palace area. Reaching the outer "rings" of the central palace we start getting to public areas. We're taken to a tall tower with holes/tunnels that lead to other parts of the library.

### The Library
A salamander-looking creature types something on a typewriter in the reception. They use a coral-like quill, and traces something on a piece of paper. The sheet floats up, and takes the shape of a salamander humanoid. Thaea picks it up. The paper sheet has a rune and works like a translator.

I don't find books, instead metal tubes that are stored in compartments. Each tube, or scroll holder, has a sigil or some writing I can't understand.

Seelie: summer, spring. Unseelie: winter, fall. Archfey that represents the seasons are often more reverred than the halls that don't represent them.

**No Longer Meta:**
- Milretha, Archfey of Lucent Hall (Spring). An archfey that is associated with the well-being of all of the fey.
- Raalnim Somhairle, Archfey of Hall of Mirage (Summer). Hall of Mirage and Lucent Hall have tight bonds and are always communicating, despite the long distance between them.

Queen Titania of the Seelie court and her sister of the Unseelie court, Queen of Air and Darkness, for reasons now lost to time, the two sisters quarreled in a realm dividing argument. Ever since the two courts have beef, even when the two sisters have fallen into slumbers.

Aspen finds a children's book about the Seelie and Unseelie courts. The sisters used to have a warm relationship. Some force interfered and made them _beef_.

Queen of Air and Darkness is a title that she used to separate from her old identity, after she became an archfey. Lesser fey can become archfey when a time of need arises. Each archfey represents a concept (like devils from chainsawman), their power is proportional to how much their concept is worshipped or valued. Different times may change how strong an archfey is (war, famine, prosperity, etc.). In the beginning there were two concepts: light and darkness. With time, lesser people developed thought and more granular concepts. The power of the sisters then was partitioned to these other archfeys.

Thaea takes us to a counter, there's a typewriter on top. A scroll is fetched.

Bio mechanical infrastructure is the basis of the Lucent hall. There are two massive archways, the first is the archway of life, the other of death. They start apart and converge with time, although they never completely diverge or converge. They count the deaths and lives of _every person in the feywild_. Funnily enough, the illustration of the rings looks rose gold instead of copper (like it was when we went there). In the feywild, the reason why people are born and die is because of the Lucent Hall's court archfey, Milretha. When we were there, the clockwork on the city's underground ticks sounded slow, dragged, almost like a dying heart beat. If the veil is the protective barrier of the whole fey and it's thinning, it would make sense why the arches' pace is off.

Arwan left to join the Lucent hall 80 years ago, when he was the equivalent to 20 in human years.

**Aspen's scrolls**
1. First there was darkness, then there was light. Then day and night, and life and death. This was the beginning of the fairy plane. The conflict created a rift. Hatred for one another became a part of the people, it became the norm to hate the opposition. [Missing info]

2. **Title: A tale of 2 sisters.** One of the sisters was warm with golden hair. The other was cold and had dark hair. They were inseperable nonetheless. The two wondered into the forest. At first it was wonderous, they couldnt get enough of traversing deeper into the forest. But soon they reached a point where the woods became much too dark, they couldn't see much. The warm, cheerful sister hid behind her sibling for protection, she was afraid of the dark. They pressed forward and found themselves in a strange place. Home, but it wasn't really home. Darkness was light here, light was darkness. They pressed forward and found a house, one that looked like theirs. They opened the door, but they didn't find their parents. A hunched, wrinkly woman looked down at them with a single glaring eye. The golden girl was much too afraid to speak, and cried. Her sister, attempting to protect her sister, introduced herself, giving her name to the old woman. The golden girl, who was unpolite, was to be kept in the woods while her sister was let home. They refused to be separated, but alas such was the way. She returned home as promised, her parents embraced her. But all she felt was worry for her sister, which she left behind in the woods. The golden sister was never seen again.

**Names play an important name in this realm.**

**Now Poko knows the full names of all party members. Sothro's orc title is "Bone Splitter".**

We use the typewriter to ask for our party name. A single scroll drops and it tells the story of our party with freakish accuracy. Down to how the party met each other, to Sir Tramlaw, to Aspen, Mival and Poko's deaths. The author's name is: **Allsmutter**, and Poko feels like this name carries a lot of power. Poko, Akamien, Sothro, Mival. Upon touching Sothro's name, the words rearrange themselves. They reassamble into a wiki page written in common. There's a portrait of him, altho it looks kinda blurry. Sothro's bday is listed, it was on 2 Ches 1461. He used to live in Winter's Edge, moved to Filvathyr when his mom died. Then he left to Vuz Kholdrugh, then to Argent Spade and finally BotS.

**I touch my name, the words start reassembling. "Poko" it reads. Date of birth is smudged. Mother: Himel, Father: (smudged). Early life (written in abyssal): everything is blurred, a name is blurred for a second it's legible. _Tenn, Salvationist. "There is still time", a voice whispers in abyssal_.**

We look up "Thoctuth". A page is rendered. Star of Shohketh: Practitioner of the arcane, Dophoas. Even by his people's standards he was a genius. His ego allowed his knowledge to survive, but it was also what doomed him.

Thealthel: another symbol, this one looks like a sharp "P". Not much is known about Thealthel other than her name and it is theorized that she was the last one to die, her creations outlived her. She was referred to by scholars as "the last survivor".

The blight, as it seems, isn't public knowledge. We know about it thru our connections and purpose here, but it's purposefully being kept low as to not cause a panic among the people.

### The Market
Seasonal halls seem to hold their weather in a "stasis". The Winter hall is, surprise surprise, cold all the time. It's bustling with fairies, centaurs, eladryns, tieflings and every fey folk. Winter eladryns seem unbothered by the cold judging by their clothings. We head to a commercial area, an old tree with purple trees stand in the middle of the square. Thaea guides us through the square. Petals fall over us, like purple snow. We get to some dingy looking buildings with narrow alleyways and little houses crudely made with bamboo and wood, feebly illuminated by two lamps that hang on the walls. A merchant with a large basket hat (tengai) sells items. He's called "The Peddler".

### Luthria
They examined Mival and no longer need him. She tells us that she'll help us cure Mival's mom. She shows a map and traces a path to a forested and dark area. **"You must head to Nén Guenhwyvarûn. Uncover The Tears of Mnemosyne, the tears of the children shall be essential if you are to make your final bargain."**
