reminders:
    - Sothro said he might know someone who could help me either recover my memories or help with the incarnation spell. He tells Mival that the person is a priestess he used to know who could communicate with his ancestors, but he didn’t tell Poko that cause Poko said he would be interested in it after they figure everything out with the Feywild.
    - Aspen best friend forever

An orc comes in, wearing a coat. \
**Rohzakk (Proud Sunderer, 27) is the name of the blade. He knows Sothro (29).**\
Sothro seems to have bad blood with Rohzakk.\
White hair, black sash\
Red sash\
We finally meet **Haothrouh The One-Eyed (31)**, she’s surprisingly understanding of Sothro’s unceremonious departure\
Leylines - what we used to cast spells, they can conglomerate and create rifts. Casters can trace these lines to find portals\
Arcanags\
The Veilkeeper isn’t failing at its job necessarily, the problem about the veil getting thinner stems from our plane somehow\
Hao calls Thaea “Beast tamer”. Even tho Chydreth wasn’t there.\
**Chydreth (?) is the name of the chimera**\
Kholdrugh has crops\
White Hands of Yurtrus and followers of Shargaas\
Yurtrus and Shargaas are gods.\
**Gruumsh, one of their god. He’s a warmonger**\ 
**Lúthic, Gruumsh’s wife. She’s a healer, still a warmonger**.\ 
**Orcish tribes tend to follow gods of war, leaning to certain deities in the pantheon. Kholdrugh in particular favors direct combat, which is why Shargaas and Yurtrus’ are viewed as underhanded. Shargaas is followed by assassins, uses poison, sickness.**\ 
Ilnevar, another god, he’s Gruumsh’s strategist and son.\ 
**Corellon, leader of the elvish gods took one of Gruumsh’s eyes in one of their wars. This is partly why both species kinda hate each other**\
Also why orcs usually have scars across their eyes. It’s seen as an honor, a sign of selection by Gruumsh.\
All tribes worship Gruumsh\
