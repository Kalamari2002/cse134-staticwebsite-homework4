            <h3>Notes</h3>
            <p>Deep woods, on our way to Galingriad <br>
Raouss uses hill rune (rose named it power rune)<br>
Red, Pink are slown<br>
Poko, half covered<br>
Chidreth uses firebreath<br>
Sothro uses searing smite, con save, 1d6 fire,<br>
Sothro gets a crit on 19 and 20<br>
Raouss uses damage transfer, named Earnest Defender, an ability that lets him take a portion of damage in place of his companions<br>
Mival makes the chad mushroom of his army of mushrooms force the Worg’s mouth open, its comrades trailing behind it, entering the Worg’s body and sprouting from its eyes and nostrils and orifices.<br>
<strong>The Worgs were corrupted</strong><br>
Grand courtyard, winter garden, black sand in the garden is arranged in patterns. The weather in Midnight court is colder<br>
We head over to a central tower, a skyscraper looking building<br>
The inside of the tower is wider and slightly shorter than what it appears on the outside<br>
On the top, we find a tall, slim woman, with long, claw-like fingers that scrape the sand<br>
Her skin is pale, like her outfit. She moves almost like she’s floating<br>
When she comes near us, she seems to get shorter to match Thaea’s height<br>
<strong>It’s the Veilkeeper, Archfey of the Midnight Hall</strong><br>
“Child, come forth” she commands Mival<br>
We are taken to the wing of the palace, a house-like structure.<br>
We’re taken to an Aeternum meeting, Thaea’s boss is expected to attend.<br>
A deep red haired lady stands next to the Veilkeeper<br>
<strong>Luthria, Lady of Deluge, Archfey of the Serein Hall (Fall representative)</strong>. She looks like Undyne kinda<br>
Mival was born under a fairy moon, so he’s attuned with their plane apparently<br>
Luthria tells that his magic has roots on the Fey. It’s a reverse engineering of the Blight<br>
The Aeternum is investigating the Blight<br>
How a force of the prime material plane has touched the raw magic of the Fey.<br>
Luge has observed the Blight, determined it originated from the prime material plane<br>
It’s become more present<br>
<strong>Mival can use magic from the fey without facing its consequences, the veil doesn’t repel him</strong></p>
