            <h3>Notes</h3>
            <p>We’re in a cell, a guard wearing rose tinted armor checks on us<br>
<strong>That guard is from the Dawn Guard (meta, poko doesn’t know this)</strong><br>
The bug looking guards that arrested us are from another guard, <strong>Verdant Chafers</strong><br>
<strong>Moira (their captain)</strong>
We’re taken out of the tunnels, we surface in front of a grandiose, dome palace looking building, with large arches, stained glass. The hallways are furnished with a meticulous green carpet. <br>
More guards await us, they seem to be from the Dawn guard. <br>
There are carvings of vines, plant-like appendages on the walls and pillars. <br>
Enormous mechanical arches, like Saturn's rings, slowly move around the city.<br>
Gears and cogs shift under us. Some are embedded onto wood, their function is unknown. <br>
A figure awaits us, Moira bows before them. <br>
Moira takes her helmet off. Green skin, yellow eyes, dark hair, beetle-like horn. She seems like a fey tiefling <br>
Verdant Chafers stand along the walls, like suits of armor in display <br>
The figure looks a lot like your character idea (Camilla), but green <br>
“We finally properly meet”, they say. <br>
<strong>Lucent Hall - Leading hall of The Seelie/Mirage court</strong><br>
<strong>Archfey Prince Raalnim Somhairle (Arwan Somhairle)</strong><br>
The figure, Raalnim, isn’t from the Lucent Hall, they’re from the south of the Seelie<br>
Something has befallen their archfey and lesser fey Archfey Lady Milretha. The catastrophe has begun to spread across their lands. None of the remedies or usual remedies seem to cure them.<br>
Proposal - outsider’s perspective<br>
Alliance with the court<br>
Ask for time to think about it<br>
We’re taken to a room that looks like an apartment. It follows the same mechanical/organic structure. There are pod looking seats for us.<br>
The dream is kinda really important to this<br>
<em>Why could Arwan see Mival?</em></p>
